# Repository Overview
This repository serves as an informal study guide/notes for the eJPT v2 certification. Every effort has been made to ensure the content is both comprehensive and comprehensible. It is designed for use as a handy reference during exams or for personal note-taking purposes. I strongly recommend supplementing your study with personal notes. The primary goal of this repository is to provide clarity on all topics covered in the [eJPTv2](https://security.ine.com/certifications/ejpt-certification/) courseware.

### DISCLAIMER
It is important to note that this repository does not serve as a replacement for the official INE courseware. It does not aim to teach what is already covered in the official courseware and INE Attack Defense labs.
