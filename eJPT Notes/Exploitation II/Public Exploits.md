### Searching for publicly available exploits

+ After identifying a potential vulnerability within a target or a service running on a target, the next logical step will involve searching for exploit code that can be used to exploit the vulnerability.

+ There are a handful of legitimate and vetted exploit databases that you should use when searching for exploits online:
	+ Exploit-db
