### How to enumerate in a black box pentest ?

1. In a black box pentest in the INE course, we won't be provided with the target IP address. The target IP can be found in the `hosts` file.
```
cat /etc/hosts
```
- We should have a IP assigned to `demo.ine.local`

2. We'll now create a new folder to store all the files that are important regards to the penetration test. 

3. Firstly, we'll perform a ping scan to check if the host is up. Then, we'll perform a `nmap` service version detection scan to enumerate the services running on the target system.
