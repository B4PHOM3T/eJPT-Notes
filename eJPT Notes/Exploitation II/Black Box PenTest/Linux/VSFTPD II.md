### Black box testing on Linux FTP 

1. In our case we are performing a black box pentest on a Linux machine.

2. The machine is running a VSFTPD 2.3.4 server on port 21. This version is vulnerable to command execution. 

3. If we take a look at the exploit Python code, we can see that it connects with Telnet through port 6200 at one point, but since the sysadmin has closed the port in the target system, the exploit won't work. 

4. This proves that in some cases, the exploit won't work as they've been patched.

5. Since we are unable to use the exploit to gain access, we can go with bruteforcing FTP. 

6. To do this, we can start by enumerating user accounts using SMTP.
