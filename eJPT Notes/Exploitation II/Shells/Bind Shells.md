### What is a Bind Shell ?

+ A bind shell is a type of remote shell where the attacker connects directly to a listener on the target system, consequently allowing for execution of commands on the target system.

+ A Netcat listener can be setup to execute a specific executable like `cmd.exe` or `/bin/bash` when a client connects to the listener.

- The attacker connects to the Netcat listener on target.

**Challenges of using bind shell**

1. The attacker might not be able to connect with the target at all due to security mechanisms blocking incoming connections. 
2. To establish connection, we need the target PC to have Netcat installed and a listener running on it. Netcat is not installed on Windows devices by default. If it isn't installed, we won't be able to connect. 

**Advantages of a reverse shell over bind shell**

1. In case of a reverse shell, the listener is setup on the attacker machine. The target machine instead connects to the attacker machine. 
2. Outgoing traffic from a system is rarely blocked by security mechanisms, this will help the target machine connect to the attacker without raising much suspicion. 

### How to setup a bind shell using `nc` ?

1. Send the `nc.exe` file in the `/usr/share/windows-binaries/` directory, by hosting it using `SimpleHTTPServer`.

2. In order to setup a bind shell, the target system needs to have a `nc` listener setup.\
```
nc.exe -lnvp <port> -e cmd.exe
```
- `-e` - Execute a program when a client connects to this listener. In our case, we'll be executing `cmd` to provide command shell session to the attacker. 

3. In our attacker machine, we'll be connecting to
