### What is a Bind Shell ?

+ A bind shell is a type of remote shell where the attacker connects directly to a listener on the target system, consequently allowing for execution of commands on the target system.

+ A Netcat listener can be setup to execute a specific executable like `cmd.exe` or `/bin/bash` when a client connects to the listener.
