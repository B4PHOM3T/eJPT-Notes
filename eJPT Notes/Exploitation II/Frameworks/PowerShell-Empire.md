### What is PowerShell-Empire ?

+ PowerShell-Empire (Aka Empire) is a pure PowerShell exploitation/post-exploitation framework built on cryptological-secure communications and flexible architecture.

+ Empire implements the ability to run PowerShell agents without needing powershell.exe, rapidly deployable post-exploitation modules ranging from keyloggers to Mimikatz, and adaptable communications to evade network detection, all wrapped up in a usability-focused framework.

+ PowerShell Empire recently received an update and is now officially support and maintained by Kali Linux, more information regarding the update can be found here:

### What is Starkiller ?

+ In addition to being updated and modernized, BC Security, the company responsible, for maintaining the Empire has also developed a companion to Empire called Starkiller. 

+ Starkiller is a GUI Frontend for the Powershell Empire. It is an Electron application written in VuelS and provides users with an intuitive way of interacting with Empire.

+ In order to get an understanding of how Empire works and the components that make up the framework, I would recommend going through the official documentation which can be found here: https:/www.powershellempire.com/ 

+ PowerShell-Empire & Starkiller are both available as packages in the Kali Linux repositories.
