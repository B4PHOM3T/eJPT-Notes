- EternalBlue (MS17-010/CVE-2017-0144) is the name given to a collection of Windows vulnerabilities and exploits that allow attackers to remotely execute arbitrary code and gain access to a Windows system and consequently the network that the target system is a part of.

- The EternalBlue exploit was developed by the NSA (National Security Agency) to take advantage of the MS17-010 vulnerability and was leaked to the public by a hacker group called the Shadow Brokers in 2017.

- The EternalBlue exploit takes advantage of a vulnerability in the Windows SMBV1 protocol that allows attackers to send specially crafted packets that consequently facilitate the execution of arbitrary commands.
