- SMB (Server Message Block) is a network file sharing protocol that is used to facilitate the sharing of files and peripherals (printers and serial ports) between computers on a local network (LAN).

- SMB uses port 445 (TCP). However, originally, SMB ran on top of NetBIOS using port 139.

- SAMBA is the open source Linux implementation of SMB, and allows Windows systems to access Linux shares and devices.
