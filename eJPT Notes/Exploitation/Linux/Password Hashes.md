- Linux has multi-user support and as a result, multiple users can access the system simultaneously. This can be seen as both an advantage and disadvantage from a security perspective, in that, multiple accounts offer multiple access vectors for attackers and therefore increase the overall risk of the server.

- All of the information for all accounts on Linux is stored in the passwd file located in: `etc/passwd`

- We cannot view the passwords for the users in the passwd file because they are encrypted and the passwd file is readable by any user on the system.

- All the encrypted passwords for the users are stored in the shadow file. it can be found in the following directory: `/etc/shadow`

- The shadow file can only be accessed and read by the root account, this is a very important security feature as it prevents other accounts on the system from accessing the hashed passwords.

- `passwd` file  contains the users' public information (UID, full name, home directory), while `shadow` contains the hashed password and the password expiry data.
