- Shellshock (CVE-2014-6271) is the name given to a family of vulnerabilities in the Bash shell (since V1.3) that allow an attacker to execute remote arbitrary commands via Bash, consequently allowing the attacker to obtain remote access to the target system via a reverse shell.

- The Shellshock vulnerability was discovered by St√©phane Chazelas on the 12th of September 2014 and was made public on the 24th of September 2014.

- Bash is a Unix shell that is part of the GNU project and is the default shell for most Linux distributions. Windows doesn't utilise Bash, as it isn't a Unix based OS.
