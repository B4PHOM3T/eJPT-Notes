- Linux implements task scheduling through a utility called Cron.

- Cron is a time-based service that runs applications, scripts and other commands repeatedly on a specified schedule.

- An application, or script that has been configured to be run repeatedly with Cron is known as a Cron job. Cron can be used to automate or repeat a wide variety of functions on a system, from daily backups to system upgrades and patches.

- The crontab file is a configuration file that is used by the Cron utility to store and track Cron jobs that have been created.
