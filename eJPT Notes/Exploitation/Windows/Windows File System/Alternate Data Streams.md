### What are Alternate Data Streams (ADS) ?

- ADS stands for "Alternate Data Streams" in Windows. It's a feature of the NTFS (New Technology File System) file system used in Windows operating systems. ADS allows you to attach additional data to a file, which is not part of the main file content but is still associated with it.

- It was also designed to provide compatibility with the MacOS HFS (Hierarchical File System). 

- Any file created on an NTFS formatted drive will have two different forks/streams: 
	+ Data stream - Default stream that contains the actual data of the file. 
	+ Resource stream - Typically contains the metadata of the file.

- Attackers can use ADS to hide malicious code or executables in legitimate files in order to evade detection.

- This can be done by storing the malicious code or executables in the file attribute resource stream (metadata) of a legitimate file.

- This technique is usually used to evade basic signature based AVs and static scanning tools.
