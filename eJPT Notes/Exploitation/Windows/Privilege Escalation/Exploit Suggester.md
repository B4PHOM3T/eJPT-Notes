### How to setup ?

1. To use Windows Exploit Suggester, we first need the target system info.
2. Open a command shell session using `shell` command.
3. Use command `systeminfo` to get the target system information.
4. Copy the output of `systeminfo` into a text file. 
5. The output will also contain the list of `hotfixes` that have been installed on the target computer. 
6. The Windows Exploit Suggester will determine what exploits can be used on the target Windows based on these `hotfixes`.

### How to use ?

- Go to the directory where `windows-exploit-suggester.py` is installed.
- On the first run, we won't have MS vulnerability database installed.
- To install the database run the command:
```
windows-exploit-suggester.py --update
```
- This will save the database in a `xls` file, such as `2023-09-19-mssb.xls`
- Run the Python script:
```
./windows-exploit-suggester.py --database <database> --systeminfo <sysinfo-file>
```
- The script will enumerate a list of vulnerabilities that the target Windows is vulnerable to.

*Now that we know what exploits the target system is vulnerable to, we can start exploiting it, or use the exploits for privilege escalation.*

### How to exploit ?

Download Exploits - https://github.com/SecWiki/windows-kernel-exploits/

- Now have a list of vulnerabilities suggested by the script.
- We can now copy the Microsoft vulnerbility ID and perform a Google search on it to learn more about it and download the exploit (if available) from
