### What are Windows Access Tokens ?

- Windows access tokens are a core element of the authentication process on Windows and are created and managed by the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS).

- A Windows access token is responsible for identifying and describing the security context of a process or thread running on a system. Simply put, an access token can be thought of as a temporary key akin to a web cookie that provides users with access to a system or network resource without having to provide credentials each time a process is started or a system resource is accessed.

- Access tokens are generated by the `winlogon.exe` process every time a user authenticates successfully and includes the identity and privileges of the user account associated with the thread or process. This token is then attached to the `userinit.exe` process, after which all child processes started by a user will inherit a copy of the access token from their creator and will run under the privileges of the same access token.
