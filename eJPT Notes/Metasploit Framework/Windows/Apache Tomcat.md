+ Apache Tomcat, also known as Tomcat server, is a popular, free and open source Java
servlet web server.

+ tis used to build and host dynamic websites and web applications based on the Java

### Difference between Apache and Apache Tomcat

+ The standard Apache HTTP web server is used to host static and dynamic websites
or web applications, typically developed in PHP.

+ The Apache Tomcat web server is primarily used to host dynamic websites or web
applications developed in Java.

+ Apache Tomcat V8.5.19 is vulnerable to a remote code execution vulnerability that
could potentially allow an attacker to upload and execute a JSP payload in order to
gain remote access to the target server.

+ We can utilize a prebuilt MSF exploit module to exploit this vulnerability and
consequently gain access to the target server.
