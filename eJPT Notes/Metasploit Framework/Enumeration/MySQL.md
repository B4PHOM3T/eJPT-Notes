+ MySQL is an open-source relational database management system based on SQL (Structured Query Language).

+ It is typically used to store records, customer data, and is most commonly deployed to store web application data.

+ MySQL utilizes TCP port 3306 by default, however, like any service it can be hosted on any open TCP port.

+ We can utilize auxiliary modules to enumerate the version of MySQL, perform brute-force attacks to identify passwords, execute SQL queries and much more.
