+ Pivoting is a post exploitation technique that involves utilizing a compromised host to attack other systems on the compromised host's private internal network.

+ After gaining access to one host, we can use the compromised host to exploit other hosts on the same internal network to which we could not access previously.

+ Meterpreter provides us with the ability to add a network route to the internal network's subnet and consequently scan and exploit other systems on the network.
