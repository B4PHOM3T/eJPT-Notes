+ `Nessus` is a proprietary vulnerability scanner developed by Tenable. 

+ We can utilize `Nessus` to perform a vulnerability scan on a target system, after which, we can import the `Nessus` results in to `MSF` for analysis and exploitation. 

+ `Nessus` automates the process of identifying vulnerabilities and also provides us with information pertinent to a vulnerability like the CVE code. 

+ We can use the free version of Nessus (Nessus Essentials), which allows us to scan upto 16 IPs. 

- After installation, it'll run on our localhost on port 8834.
