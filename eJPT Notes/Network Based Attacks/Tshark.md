**Tshark**Â is a command line tool created by the Wireshark team and shares the same powerful parsing engine as Wireshark. It is capable of doing most things we've come to love Wireshark for, but with the "from command line" advantage. This makes it ideal for batch analysis, offline processing and routine automation of traffic analysis tasks.

- `Tshark` is used more for target analysis, we can use it to pull any specific information out instead of going through everything like we were doing in `WireShark`. Its more in-depth, targeted and faster. 

- We can look at the `Tshark` version info using `tshark -v` and the help menu using `tshark -h`. We can pipe the help menu through `more` - `tshark -h | more`. This will give us a better view of the long help menu by showing one page at a time.

- To see the list of interfaces on the system we can use `tshark -D`

- We can run a packet capture on a interface using `tshark -i <interface-name>`

- We can display the contents of a `pcap` file using - `tshark -r <capture_file.pcap>`. This will display all the lines of captures at once which can overwhelm us.  

- To check the protocol hierarchy, we can use command-
```
tshark -r <pcap-file> -z io,phs -q
```
