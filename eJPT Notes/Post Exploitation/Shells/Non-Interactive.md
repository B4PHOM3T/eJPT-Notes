### Upgrading Non-Interactive Shells

1. In this case, we'll be exploiting SAMBA with `is_known_pipename` module in `MSF` to gain a non-interactive command shell session. 

2. The easiest way to identify that a shell is non-interactive is that it doesn't provide us with any prompt. We can perform only very basic tasks with it. 

3. We can upgrade this session to an interactive bash session using `/bin/bash -i`. A bash session is more stable than a normal command shell session. 

4. In some cases, the target system might not have a bash shell installed. In that case, we can use a different shell. Use `cat /etc/shells` to check the list of shells installed in the system. 
	+ If bourne shell is installed we can use `/bin/sh -i` to use it.
