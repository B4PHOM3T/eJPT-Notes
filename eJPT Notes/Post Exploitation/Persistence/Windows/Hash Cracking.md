### Dumping & Cracking NTLM Hashes

1. To learn the basics about password hashes, refer to [[eJPT Notes/Exploitation/Windows/Credential Dumping/Password Hashes|Password Hashes]]

2. We can dump Windows password hashes by leveraging various utilities like:
	+ The inbuilt meterpreter “hashdump” command
	+ Mimikatz

3. After we have dumped the hashes, we can crack them through the use of the following utilities:
	+ John The Ripper
	+ Hashcat

### How to obtain the NTLM hashes ?

1. Gain initial access and migrate to the `lsass` process, this will make our `meterpreter` session more stable in context of accessing the `lsass` process cache. 

2. We can use the `hashdump` command to check the NTLM hashes of all the users in the system. We can also use the `net user` command in the target shell to check whether we've obtained the hashes for all the users in the system. 

3. Now we'll save the hashes we obtained inside a text file.
