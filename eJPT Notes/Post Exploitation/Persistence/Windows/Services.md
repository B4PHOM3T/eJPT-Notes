Techniques used for persistence include any access, action, or configuration changes that let them maintain their foothold on systems, such as replacing or hijacking legitimate code or adding startup code. - MITRE ATT&CK

+ Gaining an initial foothold is not enough, you need to setup and maintain persistent access to your targets.
