### What is Pivoting ?

+ Pivoting is a post exploitation technique that involves utilizing a compromised host that is connected to multiple networks to gain access to systems within other networks.

+ After gaining access to one host, we can use the compromised host to exploit other hosts on a private internal network to which we could not access previously.

+ `Meterpreter` provides us with the ability to add a network route to the internal network's subnet, perform port forwarding and consequently scan and exploit other systems on the network.

### What is Port Forwarding ?

+ Port forwarding is the process of redirecting traffic from a specific port on a target system to a specific port on our system.

+ In the context of pivoting, we can forward a remote port on a previously inaccessible host to a local port on our Kali Linux system so that we can remotely interact/exploit the service running on the port.
