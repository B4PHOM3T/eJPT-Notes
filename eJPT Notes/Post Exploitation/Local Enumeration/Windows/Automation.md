### Automating Windows Local Enumeration

+ In addition to performing local enumeration manually, we can also automate the process with the help of a few scripts and MSF modules.

+ While local enumeration techniques/commands are important to know, as a penetration tester, you will need to be time efficient. As a result, you will need to learn how to utilize various automated enumeration scripts.

+ In addition to automating the process of enumerating information like system information, users & groups etc, these automated enumeration scripts will also provide you with additional information regarding the target system like; privilege escalation vulnerabilities, locally stored passwords etc. 

### Windows Local Enumeration Scripts

+ JAWS - Just Another Windows (Enum) Script - JAWS is PowerShell script designed to help penetration testers (and CTFers) quickly identify potential privilege escalation vectors on Windows systems. It is written using PowerShell 2.0 so 'should' run on every Windows version since Windows 7.

### How to perform ?

1. Gain initial access.

2. We can check if the system has any external hard drive connected to it using the `show_mount` command on the `meterpreter` shell.

3. We can use the `win_privs` module to get the privileges of the current user.
```
use post/windows/gather/win_privs
```

5. Using `checkvm` module to check whether the system is a VM. 
```
use post/windows/gather/checkvm
```

6. Enumerating the installed applications and their versions. 
```
use post/windows/gather/enum_applications
```
