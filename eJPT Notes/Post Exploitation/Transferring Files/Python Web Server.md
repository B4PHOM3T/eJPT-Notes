### Transferring Files to Target Systems

+ After obtaining initial access to a target system, you will need to transfer files to the target system.

+ In some cases, you will not have access to the target system via a `Meterpreter` session, and as a result, you will need to use the inbuilt OS specific utilities to facilitate the transfer of files from your system to the target system.

+ This process utilizes a two-step approach, where you will need to host the files you want to transfer on a web server and download the files hosted on the web server to the target system.
