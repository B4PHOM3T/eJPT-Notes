### How to clear tracks on Linux ?

1. Exploit the target and gain initial access. 

2. Whenever transferring files to a Linux system, we should always upload it to the `/tmp` directory, located under the `/` root directory. 

3. The contents of the `tmp` directory gets deleted automatically after a certain period of time.

4. On most Linux systems we would typically find a bash history `.bash_history` file inside the home directory which would store the history of commands typed on the terminal. This is typically used as a security mechanism by system admins to see what users are doing. 

5. We can use the `history` command to check the list of commands that the user has typed in the current session.
